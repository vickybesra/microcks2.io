In the **ever-evolving landscape** of **open-source software**, achieving **recognition** and **support** from **reputable foundations can be a game-changer** for projects. This was precisely the case for [Microcks](https://microcks.io/), an **innovative API mocking and testing project**. When Microcks joined the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) Sandbox a year ago, opportunities opened. In this blog post, we'll delve into Microcks's exciting journey as it embraced its [CNCF Sandbox](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=microcks) status and explore the profound positive impacts the project experienced in its **first year within the foundation**.

**Microcks' Integration into the CNCF Sandbox: A Milestone of Success**

Microcks took a **significant step forward** by becoming part of the **CNCF Sandbox**, a space dedicated to nurturing early-stage cloud-native projects. The CNCF, well-known for supporting and promoting cloud-native technologies, provided Microcks with a platform that validated its potential and exposed it to a **vast community of developers**, **enterprises**, and **enthusiasts**. This integration was marked by Microcks' announcement in the blog post titled "[Microcks Joining CNCF Sandbox](https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-joining-cncf-sandbox/)", a testament to our community dedication and ambition.


## The 1-Year Transformation: Positive Impacts on Microcks

**1. Rapid Growth and Adoption**

One of the most visible impacts of Microcks' inclusion in the CNCF Sandbox is its **exponential growth**. This growth is vividly evident in the [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/microcks/.github/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md) file on Microcks' GitHub repository. This file is a directory of organizations and projects that have embraced Microcks as part of their development workflow. Over the first year, the **list of adopters expanded significantly**, reflecting **the rising popularity** and **utility of the Microcks project**.

* Public adopters have grown from **1 to 16** in just a year, spanning various verticals and geographies! üåçüöÄüòä
* Private adopters (companies who are not yet listed publicly but are in touch with the community) now include **more than 20 organizations**... üöÄü§ùüòä

>Moving from private to public adopters is a small contribution that makes a big impact. It greatly helps the project gain momentum and credibility. Your support is truly important for our growth! üåüüôè

As enterprises and developers integrated Microcks into their development lifecycle practices, it became evident that the **CNCF affiliation increased the project's visibility** and **instilled higher trust among our community users**. Being part of the CNCF family inherently brings a sense of credibility and reliability, a factor that likely contributed to Microcks' rapid adoption.

Keep discovering by reading adopters' testimonials:

* [CNAM Partners with Microcks for Automated SOAP Service Mocking](https://microcks.io/blog/cnam-soap-service-mocking/)
* [Extend Microcks with custom libs and code](https://microcks.io/blog/extend-microcks-with-custom-libs/)
* [J.B. Hunt: Mock It till You Make It with Microcks](https://microcks.io/blog/jb-hunt-mock-it-till-you-make-it/)

**2. Embracing the "Shift Left" Paradigm**

Microcks' tenure in the CNCF Sandbox has reinforced the **importance of the "shift left" approach to software development**. The "shift left" [paradigm](https://developer.paypal.com/community/blog/shiftleft-softwareqa/) emphasizes addressing issues as early in the development cycle as possible, reducing the chances of critical problems emerging in later stages. In Microcks‚Äô context, this translates to incorporating API mocking and testing right from the outset of development.

The shift left approach was expertly outlined in the informative article "[Mocking and Contract Testing in Your Inner Loop with Microcks](https://medium.com/itnext/mocking-and-contract-testing-in-your-inner-loop-with-microcks-part-1-easy-environment-setup-dcd0f4355231)". This piece elaborates on how Microcks' inner loop focus empowers developers to mock APIs and run contract tests early in their development cycle. This leads to **swifter identification** and **resolution of issues**, allowing **developers** to **iterate more efficiently** and ultimately **deliver higher-quality** software.

**Metrics for [Testcontainers Microcks‚Äô module](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks/) downloads and usage are rapidly increasing**, demonstrating the need and enthusiasm of developers: üåü

* From 500 downloads in Q4 2023 üöÄ
* To over **2K downloads in May 2024** üéâ

**The same goes for our popular [Docker Desktop Extension](https://www.docker.com/blog/get-started-with-the-microcks-docker-extension-for-api-mocking-and-testing/)**: listed among the top [extensions every developer must try](https://dzone.com/articles/docker-desktop-extensions-every-developer-must-try) and **installed over 6.4K times**! üöÄüåüüòä

Since day one, the Microcks project has been robust and efficient in managing **all kinds of API use cases** for your outer loop. Based on adopters and community feedback, we now have a lighter and faster version of Microcks named [microcks-uber](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/tree/1.9.x/distro/uber). By packaging our Microcks Java application into a platform-native binary using [GraalVM native](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) and [Spring Boot AOT](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html) compilation, we've achieved an incredible **startup time of just 300 milliseconds**, consuming very few resources!

We are now the **ultimate tool** to **bridge the gap** between **development on a laptop** and **centralized, highly scalable operations on Kubernetes**. üöÄüíªüåê

**3. Better Together: Eco-System Orientation**

The CNCF Sandbox status brings a **sense of camaraderie** and the opportunity to be part of a **broader ecosystem**. This "better together" **mindset** encourages projects to explore **integrations and collaborations** that enrich the **developer experience**.

Microcks' alignment with the CNCF **ecosystem** is a testament to this ethos. The project isn't just about standalone functionality and fitting into the larger cloud-native landscape. Microcks demonstrates its commitment to creating a **seamless developer experience** within the CNCF ecosystem by promoting compatibility with other **cloud-native technologies**.
