## Introduction

From the page displaying basic information on your [API or Service mocks](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started), you have the ability to launch new tests against different endpoints that may be representing different environment into your development process. Hitting the **NEW TEST...** button, leads you to the following form where you will be able to specify a target URL for the test, as well as a Runnerâ€”a testing strategy for your new launch:

This reference documentation walks you through the different parameters available when launching a new test on Microcks. All the parameters mentioned below are available whether you're launching a Test via the Web UI, via the [API](/documentation/guides/automation/api), via the [CLI](/documentation/guides/automation/api) or any other libraries.

### Service under test

**Service under test** is simply the reference of the API/Service specification we use as a reference for this test. This a couple of `Service Name` and `Service Version`. Depending on the **Runner** you choose, Microcks while reuse the information of an [Artifact](/documentation/overview/main-concepts/#artifacts) attached to this Service name and version.

### Test Endpoint

The **Test Endpoint** is simply a URI where a deployed component is providing an endpoint implementing your API specification. In the testing literature, this is usually defined as the URI of the [System Under Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test).

Depending on your API/Service type and the protocol binding you want to connect with (especially for event-based APIs), Test Endpoints mays have different specific syntax. Please jump to the [Endpoints syntax section](#endpoints-syntax) on this page to learn more.

### Test Runner

Microcks offers different strategies for running tests on endpoints where our microservice being developed are deployed. We recommend having a read at our explanations on [Conformance Testing](/documentation/explanations/conformance-metrics). Such strategies are implemented as **Test Runners**. Here are the default Test Runners available within Microcks:
			
| <div style="width: 160px">Test Runner</div> | <div style="width: 160px">API & Service Types</div> | Description |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `HTTP` | REST and SOAP | Simplest test runner that only checks that valid target endpoints are deployed and available - it means return a `20x` or `404` Http status code when appropriated. This can be called a simple "smock test". |
| `SOAP` | SOAP | Extension of HTTP Runner that also checks that the response is syntactically valid regarding SOAP WebService contract. It realizes a validation of the response payload using XSD schemas associated to service. |
| `SOAP_UI` | REST and SOAP | When the API artifact is defined using [SoapUI](/documentation/references/artifacts/soapui-conventions): ensures that assertions put into SoapUI Test cases are checked valid. Report failures otherwise. |
| `POSTMAN` | REST, SOAP and GRAPHQL | When the API artifact is defined using [Postman](/documentation/references/artifacts/postman-conventions): executes test scripts as specified within a Postman Collection. Report failures otherwise. | 
| `OPEN_API_SCHEMA`|  REST | When the API artifact is defined using [Open API](/documentation/references/artifacts/openapi-conventions): it executes example requests and check that results have the expected Http status and that payload is compliant with OpenAPI schema specified into OpenAPI specification. Report failures otherwise. | 
| `ASYNC_API_SCHEMA`|  EVENT | When the API artifact is defined using [Async API](/documentation/references/artifacts/asyncapi-conventions): it connects to specified broker endpoints, consume messages and check that payload is compliant with AsyncAPI schema specified into AsyncAPI specification. Report failures otherwise.|
| `GRPC_PROTOBUF`|  GRPC | When the API artifact is defined using [gRPC/Protobuf](/documentation/references/artifacts/grpc-conventions): it executes example requests and check that results payload is compliant with Protocol Buffer schema specified into gRPC protobuffer file. Report failures otherwise. |
| `GRAPHQL_SCHEMA`|  GRAPHQL | When the API is of type [GraphQL](/documentation/references/artifacts/graphql-conventions): it executes example requests and check that results payload is compliant with the GraphQL Schema of the API. Report failures otherwise. |

### Operations

Depending on the Test your are running, you may want to filter the list of operations that will be actually tested. By default, all operations are included in the test but you can pick and choose the one you want.

> ðŸ’¡ When running a Test on an Event-baed API using the `ASYNC_API_SCHEMA` strategy, you will have to choose **one and only one** operation at a time. This is because Async endpoints may be different for each and every operation so a Microcks tests can just include one Async operation. 

### Timeout

Depending on the type of Service or Tests you are running, the specification of a **Timeout** maybe mandatory. This is a numerical value expressed in milliseconds.

### Secret

Depending on the Test Endpoint you are connecting to, you may need additional authentication information - like credentials or custom X509 Certificates. You may reuse an [Authentication Secret](/documentation/guides/administration/secrets) that has been made available in the Microcks installation by your administrator.

### OAuth2

If the secured Test Endpoint cannot be accessed using a static [Authentication Secret](/documentation/guides/administration/secrets), Microcks is able to handle an OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authentication flow as the Tests prerequisites in order to retrieve an ephemeral bearer token.

The supported Oauth2 grant types are `Client credentials`, `Refresh token` and `Password`. For each of this authentication flow, you will have to provide additional information like:
* The **OAuth2 Token URI**: a URL that will be used for token retrieval,
* The **Client Id**: the OAuth2 client identifier,
* The **Client Secret**: the OAuth2 secret,
* The **Scopes**: the optional OAuth2 scopes you need (`openid` is always included).

Additionally, you will have to provide a **Refresh Token** when using the `Refresh token` grant type ðŸ˜‰

### Headers Override

This optional parameter allows you to add/override requests headers with global or operation specific ones. You have to use a comma-separated string for multiple values corresponding to the same header.

## Endpoints syntax

### HTTP based APIs

For HTTP based APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL or gRPC), this is a simple URL that should respect following pattern:

```sh
http[s]://{service.endpoint.url:port}[/{service.path}]
```

The `/{service.path}` may be optioanl if your target API is deployed on the root context.

### Event based APIs

For Event based API through [Async API](../asyncapi) testing, pattern is depending on the protocole binding you'd like to test.

#### Kafka 

Kafka Test Endpoint have the following form with optional parameters placed just after a `?` and separated using `&` character:

```sh
kafka://{kafka.broker.url:port}/{kafka.topic.name}[?param1=value1&param2=value2]
```

| Optional Params | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `registryUrl` | The URL of schema registry that is associated to the tested topic. This parameter is required when using and testing [Avro](https://avro.apache.org) encoded messages. |
| `registryUsername` | The username used if access to the registry is secured. |
| `registryAuthCredSource` | The source for authentication credentials if any. Valid values are just `USER_INFO`. |

As an example, you may have this kind of Test Endpoint value: `kafka://mybroker.example.com:443/test-topic?registryUrl=https://schema-registry.example.com&registryUsername=fred:letmein&registryAuthCredSource=USER_INFO`

#### MQTT

MQTT Test Endpoint have the following form with no optional parameters:

```sh
mqtt://{mqtt.broker.url:port}/{mqtt.topic.name}
```

#### AMQP

AMQP 0.9.1 Test Endpoint have the following form with optional parameters placed just after a `?` and separated using `&` character:

```sh
amqp://{amqp.broker.url:port}/[{amqp.vhost}/]{amqp.destination.type}/{amqp.destination.name}[?param1=value1&param2=value2]
```

`amqp.destination.type` is used to specify if we shoulf connect to either a queue (use the `q` value) or an exchange speciyfing its type: `d` dor direct, `f` for fanout, `t` for topic, `h` for headers. Then you have to specify either the queue or exchange name in `amqp.detaintion.name`.

Depending on the type of destination, you will need additional optional parameters as specified below:

| Optional Params | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `routingKey` | Used to specify a routing key for direct or topic exchanges. If not specified the `*` wildcard is used. |
| `durable` | Flag telling if exchange to connect to is durable or not. Default is `false`. |
| `h.{header}` | A bunch of headers where name starts with `h.` in order to deal with headers exchange. The `x-match` property is set to `any`to gather the most message as possible. |

As an example, you may have this kind of Test Endpoint values: `amqp://rabbitmq.example.com:5672/h/my-exchange-headers?h.h1=h1&h.h2=h2` or `amqp://rabbitmq.example.com:5672/my-vhost/t/my-exchange-topic?routingKey=foo`

#### WebSocket
