> To get started as a Docs contributor:
>

> 2. Head over to our [Microcks Docs Board](https://github.com/microcks/microcks.io/issues)
> 3. Pick an issue you would like to contribute to and leave a comment introducing yourself. This is also the perfect place to leave any questions you may have on how to get started
