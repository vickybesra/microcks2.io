Welcome to the Microcks documentation! It is intended to serve as a **reference resource** for people that discover Microcks or users who already have some familiarity with it and want to learn more.

You may find here **tutorials**, **guides**, **reference** materials as well as **explanations** to help you during your learning journey. Our documentation is organized following the principles of the [DiÃ¡taxis methodology](https://diataxis.fr/) that has this idea of a ***cycle of documentation***:

Furthermore, we **welcome contributions** to foster a **collaborative environment**. You can actively **participate** by **suggesting improvements**, **reporting errors**, or **adding new content**. This collaborative approach not only keeps the documentation **up-to-date** but also encourages a **sense of ownership** and **community engagement**, making the project **stronger** and more **reliable over time**.

By the **community**, for the **community** ðŸ™Œ
